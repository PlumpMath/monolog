## Monolog

Monolog is meant to be a quick technical blog that allows me to be more public and transparent about my process. I think of it as a cross between my [twitter account](http://twitter.com/ra) and a one-person technical forum. Posts are timestamped and not edited after publishing. The hope is to reveal not just the conclusions I reach, but the paths taken to reach them. Failures and dead-ends can be as valuable to others as successes.
